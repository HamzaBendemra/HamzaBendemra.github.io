I'm Hamza Bendemra.

Lead Data Scientist at Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA).

I focus on:
- ML strategy and architecture
- Vector databases and retrieval systems
- LLM applications in finance

Previously built ML systems at scale. Now working on the intersection of AI and investment analytics.

This site is where I document experiments, share learnings, and think out loud about ML engineering.
