# About Hamza Bendemra

I'm an AI & ML Lead at Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA), where I focus on building intelligent systems that solve complex business problems.

## Background

🎓 **PhD in Engineering** with extensive experience in applied research, data science, and statistical modeling.

Based in Abu Dhabi 🇦🇪, I've spent my career at the intersection of academic research and practical business applications, always seeking to bridge the gap between cutting-edge ML techniques and real-world impact.

## What I Do

My work centers around three key areas:

**🤖 AI & Machine Learning Strategy**  
Designing and implementing ML systems that scale from proof-of-concept to production, with a focus on explainable and human-centered approaches.

**🔍 Natural Language Processing**  
Building NLP-powered tools that transform complex data into actionable insights for stakeholders across the organization.

**🛠️ Full-Stack ML Engineering**  
Creating end-to-end solutions using Python, FastAPI, Docker, and Azure, ensuring robust deployment and continuous integration.

## Technical Expertise

**Machine Learning & AI**  
- PyTorch, scikit-learn, open-source LLMs
- Statistical modeling and applied research
- Explainable AI and human-centered design

**Development & Engineering**  
- Python (FastAPI, Streamlit, Plotly)
- Data engineering (SQL, Pandas, Synapse Analytics)
- CI/CD and cloud deployment (Docker, Azure DevOps)

**Leadership & Strategy**  
- Cross-functional team leadership
- AI strategy and roadmap development
- Stakeholder communication and data storytelling

## Philosophy

> *"I choose to share with purpose—whether to drive innovation, develop others, or grow as a leader. My work is a reflection of that principle."*

I believe that the best AI solutions are those that augment human decision-making rather than replace it. My approach focuses on building systems that are not just technically sound, but also transparent, ethical, and aligned with business objectives.

## Connect

I'm always interested in discussing AI, ML engineering, leadership in tech, or potential collaborations.
