# Temporary Favicon Setup
For now, I've set up the favicon structure. To complete it, you'll need to:

## Quick Setup (Recommended):
1. Go to https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/
2. Enter "HB" as text
3. Choose:
   - **Background**: Blue (#2563eb) or your preferred color
   - **Font**: Clean sans-serif (like Inter or Arial)
   - **Text Color**: White
4. Download the generated files
5. Replace the files in this `/assets/favicon/` directory

## Files you need:
- `favicon.ico`
- `favicon-16x16.png` 
- `favicon-32x32.png`
- `apple-touch-icon.png`

## Alternative - Manual Creation:
If you have a logo or prefer a custom design:
1. Create a 512x512px square image
2. Use https://realfavicongenerator.net/ 
3. Upload your image
4. Download and replace the files

The favicon links are already configured in your site's `<head>` section!
